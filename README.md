## What is Yak Shaving?

"Yak shaving" is a programming term coined by Carlin Vieri at MIT, inspired by an episode of Ren & Stimpy. It refers to the seemingly endless series of small tasks you must complete before you can do the thing you actually set out to do.

**Example:**
> "I just need to add a button..."
> → but first I need to update the component library
> → but first I need to upgrade Node
> → but first I need to install nvm
> → but first I need to fix my shell config
> → but first...

## The Joke

[Nair](https://naircare.com/) is a popular hair removal product. "Yak Nair" is a parody product that removes yak shaving instead of hair — helping developers skip all those prerequisite tasks and get straight to shipping.
